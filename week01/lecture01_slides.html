## Practical Concurrent and Parallel Programming
### Kasper Østerbye
### IT University of Copenhagen
### Friday 2020-08-28
---

# Plan for today
### Meta - about how this course is organized 
 
### Topics
- Java threads
- Java locking, the synchronized keyword
- Threads for performance
---

# The teachers
* Course responsible: Kasper Østerbye
* PhD 1989, Aalborg University
* Programming languages and software understanding
* Joined ITU in 2000 (but has been away for 5 years) 
* Co-teacher: Jørgen Staunstrup (will introduce himself later in the course)

---

# Why this course?

### Parallel programming is necessary
* The real world is parallel
	* Think of the atrium lifts: lifts move, buttons are pressed 
	* Think of handling a million online banking customers
* For performance
* To share ressources (think virtual machines)

### It is easy, and disastrous, to get it wrong
* Testing is even harder than for sequential code
* You should learn how to make correct parallel code * in a real language, used in practice
* You should learn how to make fast parallel code
* and measure whether one solution is faster than another * and understand why
---

# Course contents
* Threads, locks, mutual exclusion, scalability
* Java 8 streams, functional programming
* Performance measurements
* Tasks, the Java executor framework
* Safety, liveness, deadlocks
* Testing concurrent programs
* Some more advanced concepts from Java and other languages
---

# Learning objectives
> ### See formal page in LearnIT


### Expected prerequisites
* From the ITU course base:
>Students must know the Java programming language very well, including inner classes and a first exposure to threads and locks, and event-based GUIs as in Swing or AWT.”

* Today we will briefly review the basics of Java threads
- Java synchronized methods and statements - Java’s final keyword
- Java inner classes and lambdas

---
# Standard weekly plan
* Lectures Fridays in zoom
- feedback on Thursdays (zoom)
* Exercise hand-in: Thursday morning by 7
* On LearnIT, as a link to your itu github with solutions
---

# Course information online
* Course LearnIT page, restricted access:
https://learnit.itu.dk/course/view.php?id=3017108
* Course gitrepo, public access:
https://github.itu.dk/kasper/PCPP-Public
- Overview of lectures and exercises
- Lecture slides and exercise sheets
- Example code
- List of all mandatory reading materials
---

# Exercises
* There are 13 sets of weekly exercises
* You are expected to work in groups of 2-3 students, and in teams of two groups.
* Hand in the solutions through LearnIT
* Each team will be given oral feedback on Thursday - a schedule is available.
* Hand-ins: ≥6 must be submitted, ≥5 approved - otherwise you cannot take the course examination
	- failing to get 5 approved costs an exam attempt (!!)
* Exercise may be approved even if not fully solved - It is possible to resubmit
	- Make your best effort: two serious attempts=one solved
* What is important is that you learn
---
 
# Ambition levels
* We (teachers) acknowledge that you might have different ambition levels for this class and your education.
	* Exercises are in three ambition levels.
		* Green: “I want a 4, but can live with a 2”.
		* Yellow: “I want a 7, but hope for a 10”.
		* Red: “I will be disappointed if less than 10”.
	* Red must do all exercises, Yellow those marked Yellow and Green, and Green only need to do the Green.

* Groups and teams must be same ambition level.

* Oral feedback according to ambition.
---

# Exam
* A 30 hour take-home written exam/project - Electronic submission in LearnIT
	- Followed by random sample “cheat check”
* Expected exam workload is 16 hours - Individual exam, no collaboration
	- All materials, including Internet, allowed - Always credit the sources you use
	- Plagiarism is forbidden - as always
* The old exams are on the public homepage (or will soon be)
---

# Stuff you need
* Buy Goetz et al: Java Concurrency in Practice - From 2006, still the best on Java concurrency
	- Most contents is relevant for C#/.NET too
* Free lecture notes and papers, see homepage 
* A few other book chapters, see LearnIT
* Java 8 SDK installed on your computer - Java 7 or earlier will not work, later should be OK

---

# What about other languages?
* .NET and C# are very similar to Java
- We will point out differences on the way
* Kotlin, Scala, F#, ... build on JVM or .NET 

* C and C++ have some differences
* GO, Rust, Python, ...
---

# And now to concurrency and parallelism

---
# Threads and concurrency in Java
* A thread is
	- a sequential activity executing Java code
	- running at the same time as other activities
* Threads communicate via fields
	- That is, by updating shared mutable state

---

# A thread-safe class for counting
```java
class LongCounter {
  private long count = 0;
  public synchronized void increment() {
    count = count + 1;
  }
  public synchronized long get() {
    return count;
  }
} // TestLongCounter.java
```
* The state (field count) is private
* Only synchronized methods read and write it

---

# A thread created from a Runnable
The thread’s behavior is in the run method

```java
final LongCounter lc = new LongCounter();
Thread t =
  new Thread(
	  new Runnable() { //An anonymous inner class, and an instance of it
	    public void run() {
	      while (true)
					lc.increment(); 
					// When started, the thread will increment forever
			}
		} 
); // TestLongCounter7.java
```
This only creates the thread, does not start it

---

# Starting the thread 
## in parallel with the main thread

```java
public static void main(String[] args) ... { 
	final LongCounter lc = new LongCounter(); 
	Thread t = new Thread(new Runnable() { ... }); // previous slide
	t.start();
	System.out.println("Press Enter ... "); 
	while (true) {
		System.in.read();
		System.out.println(lc.get()); 
	}
}
```
```text
Press Enter to get the current value:
60853639
103606384
263682708
...
```
---

# Creating and starting a thread 
### (and communicating via object)

<img src="img/sequenceDia1.jpg" alt="drawing" style="width:80%;"/>

---

# Java lambda expressions
Instead of anonymous inner classes:
```java
 Thread t = new Thread(
    new Runnable() {
      public void run() {
        while (true)
          lc.increment(); }
}); // TestLongCounter7.java
```
we use lambda expressions:
```java
Thread t = new Thread(() -> { 
  while (true)
    lc.increment(); 
}); //TestLongCounter.java
```
_Notice: all lambda expressions are made into anonymous classes, and all anonymous classes are given unique hidden names_

---
# Locks
<img src="img/DoorClosed.jpg" alt="drawing" style="width:50%;"/>

_Notice: This door does not lock anything. _

--

However, you can use locks to establish conventions for access to resources.

---
background-image: url(img/DoorClosed_dimmed.jpg)
 
# Locks and the synchronized statement
Any Java object (door) can be used for locking

The synchronized statement
```java
	synchronized (obj) {
		... body ... }
```
- Blocks until the lock on obj is available 
- Takes (acquires) the lock on obj
- Executes the body block
- Releases the lock, also on return or exception (if the body is not run to its end)

By consistently locking on the same object
- one can obtain mutual exclusion, so
- at most one thread can execute the code at a time
---

# A synchronized method locks the “this” reference around body
A synchronized instance method
```java
class C {
  public synchronized void method() { ... } 
}
```

really uses a synchronized statement:

```java
class C {
  public void method() {
    synchronized (this) { ... } 
	}
}
```
Q: What is being locked? (The entire class, the method, the instance, the Java system)?
---

# What about synchronized static methods?
A synchronized static method
```java
class C {
  public synchronized static void method()
    { ... } 
}
```

locks on the class runtime object C.class:
```java
class C {
  public static void method() {
    synchronized (C.class) { ... } 
	}
}
```
---

# Use explicit lock objects
* So it is clear what object is being locked on 
* So only your methods lock on the object

Good:
```java
class LongCounter { 
	public synchronized void increment() { ... } 
	public synchronized long get() { ... }
}
```
Better:
```java
class LongCounterBetter {
  private final Object myLock = new Object(); // Explict lock object
  // Only these methods can lock on myLock
  public void increment() {
	  synchronized (myLock) { ... } 
	}
  public long get() { 
		synchronized (myLock) { ... }
  } 
}// TestLongCounterBetter.java
```

---

# Multiple threads, locking
Two threads incrementing counter in parallel:

```java
final int counts = 10_000_000; 
Thread t1 = new Thread(() -> { 
	for (int i=0; i < counts; i++)
		lc.increment(); 
});
Thread t2 = new Thread(() -> { 
	for (int i=0; i < counts; i++)
		lc.increment(); 
}); // TestLongCounterExperiments.java
```

* Q: How many threads are running now?
 
---

# Starting the threads,
### and waiting for their completion
```java
t1.start(); t2.start();
```
A thread completes when the lambda returns
- To wait for thread t completing, call t.join() 
- May throw InterruptedException
	
```java
try { t1.join(); t2.join(); }
catch (InterruptedException exn) { ... }
System.out.println("Count is " + lc.get());
```

 What is lc.get() after threads complete?
 - Each thread calls lc.increment() ten million times - So it gets called 20 million times

---

# Removing the locking
Non-thread-safe counter class:
```java
class LongCounter2 {
  private long count = 0;
  public void increment() {
    count = count + 1;
  }
  public long get() { return count; }
}
```
* Produces very wrong results, not 20 million:
* Q: Why?
```text
Count is 10041965
Count is 19861602
Count is 18939813
```
---

# The operation
### `count = count + 1 is not atomic`
* What count = count + 1 means: 
 - read count
 - add 1
 - write result to count
* Hence not atomic

So risk that two increment() calls will increase count by only 1
* NB: Same for `count += 1` and `count++`


---

# No locking: lost update
<img src="img/lostupdate.jpg" alt="drawing" style="width:100%;"/>

---
# Mutual exclusion (using locking)
<img src="img/mutual_exclusion.jpg" alt="drawing" style="width:100%;"/>

Locking can achieve mutual exclusion
– Lock on the *same* object before all state accesses
– Unfortunately, quite easy to get it wrong

---

# Using threads for performance 
### Example: Count primes 2 3 5 7 11 ...
Count primes in 0...9999999:
```java
static long countSequential(int range) {
  long count = 0;
  final int from = 0, to = range;
  for (int i=from; i < to; i++)
    if (isPrime(i))
      count++;
  return count;
} // TestCountPrimes.java
```
.right[Result is `664579`]

* Takes 6.4 sec to compute on 1 CPU core
* Why not use all my computer’s 4 (x 2) cores?
  - Eg. use two threads t1 and t2 and divide the work:
	t1: 0...4999999 and t2: 5000000...9999999

---
# Using two threads to count primes

```java
final LongCounter lc = new LongCounter();
final int from1 = 0, to1 = perThread; 
Thread t1 = new Thread(() -> {
  for (int i=from1; i < to1; i++)
    if (isPrime(i))
		lc.increment(); 
});
final int from2 = perThread, to2 = perThread * 2; 
Thread t2 = new Thread(() -> {
   for (int i=from2; i < to2; i++)
    if (isPrime(i))
		lc.increment(); 
}); // TestCountPrimes.java
```
Same code twice, bad practice
   
* Takes 4.2 sec real time, so already faster
* Q: Why not just use a long count variable? 
* Q: What if we want to use 10 threads?

---
# A side remark - on `final`
Why do we use `final`?

Consider this piece of code (pseudo java):
```java
()->int( incrementFrom(int start){
	return () -> {++start};
}

---

# Using N threads to count primes
```java
final LongCounter lc = new LongCounter();
Thread[] threads = new Thread[threadCount];
for (int t=0; t < threadCount; t++) {
  final int from = perThread * t,
    // Last thread has to == range
    to = (t+1 == threadCount) ? range : perThread * (t+1);
  threads[t] = new Thread(() -> { // Thread processes segment [from,to)
	for (int i=from; i < to; i++)
	  if (isPrime(i)) 
	    lc.increment();
  }); 
}
for (int t=0; t < threadCount; t++) threads[t].start();
```
Takes 1.8 sec real time with threadCount 10
- Approx 3.3 times faster than sequential solution
- Q: Why not 4 times, or 10 times faster?

---

# Reflections: threads for performance
* This code can be made better in many ways 
  - Eg better distribution of work on the 10 threads 
  - Eg less use of the synchronized LongCounter
* Use Java 8 parallel streams instead _later in course_
* Proper performance measurements, _later in course_
* Very bad idea to use many (> 500) threads 
  - Each thread takes much memory for the stack
  - Each thread slows down the garbage collector
* Use tasks and Java “executors”, _later in course_ 
* More advice on scalability, _later in course_
* How to avoid locking _later in course_
