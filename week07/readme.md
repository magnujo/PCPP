# 07 Overall performance and scaleability
This lesson will focus on techniques for preventing your parallel programs to run into eccessive locking. We will make a case study over different implementations of Maps. 

> Notice, we will have a fall break between the lecture, and the feedback sessions.

### Readings
Goetz chapter 11 and 13.5<br>
Chapter 11 has a lot of generally good discussions, but make sure to pay particular attention to the scaling strategies in section 11.4. Also, we will work a lot with those concepts in the exercises and at the lecture.

The read-write locks in Goetz 13.5 can be suplemented with a reading of javadoc for [Lock](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/locks/Lock.html) and [ReadWriteLock](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/locks/ReadWriteLock.html).
