## Practical Concurrent and Parallel Programming
### Kasper Østerbye
### IT University of Copenhagen
### Thursday 2020-08-27
---

# Plan for today
# Meta - about how this course is organized 

---

# The teachers
* Course responsible: Kasper Østerbye
- PhD 1989, Aalborg University, programmed my first machine code in 1978 (wrote an assembler in high school)
* Research interests: Programming languages and software understanding
	* Like programming languages 😀: Java, C#, Kotlin, JavaScript, Lisp, Python, C++, Smalltalk, Forth, Icon, Prolog, Simula, Pascal, Concurrent Pascal, Beta, Eiffel, ... (excuse me for mixing syntaxes once in a while).
- Joined ITU in 2000 (but has been away for 5 years) 
* Co-teacher: Jørgen Staunstrup (will introduce himself later in the course. Was my teacher on concurrency way back)


---
# Standard weekly plan
* Lectures Fridays in zoom
- feedback on Thursdays (zoom), and some written feedback
* Exercise hand-in: Thursday morning by 7
* On LearnIT, as a link to your itu github with solutions
---

# Course information online
* Course LearnIT page, restricted access:
https://learnit.itu.dk/course/view.php?id=3017108

* Course gitrepo:
https://github.itu.dk/kasper/PCPP-Public
- Overview of lectures and exercises
- Lecture slides and exercise sheets
- Example code
- List of all mandatory reading materials

---

# Stuff you need
* Buy Goetz et al: Java Concurrency in Practice - From 2006, still the best on Java concurrency
	- Most contents is relevant for C#/.NET too
* Free lecture notes and papers, will be available in github
* Java 8 SDK installed on your computer - Java 7 or earlier will not work, later should be OK

---
 
# Ambition levels
* We (teachers) acknowledge that you might have different ambition levels for this class and your education.
	* Exercises are in three ambition levels.
		* Green: “I want a 4, but can live with a 2”.
		* Yellow: “I want a 7, but hope for a 10”.
		* Red: “I will be disappointed if less than 10”.
	* Red must do all exercises, Yellow those marked Yellow and Green, and Green only need to do the Green.

* Groups and teams should be same ambition level.

* Feedback according to ambition.


---

# Exercises
* There are 13 sets of weekly exercises
- You are expected to work in groups of 2-3 students, and in teams of two groups. 
	* Your group and team is your primary source for help - you are in this together.
* Hand in the solutions through LearnIT
- Each team will be given oral feedback on Thursday - a schedule will be available.
* Hand-ins: ≥6 must be submitted, ≥5 approved - otherwise you cannot take the exam
	- failing to get 5 approved costs an exam attempt (!!)
- Exercises each week are color coded. Green level must be done to be approved.


---

# Github/LearnIT 
#### Only one solution per group
#### Hand-in on LearnIT 
The handin must be a link to your groups solution on github. 

Oral as well as written feedback will be given based on this. 

*The reason we want you to hand in the link to github is that we need to do the hand-in via learnit, and on the otherhand we want you to collaborate using github*

---

# Groups

There is an explanation of feedback on: 
https://github.itu.dk/kasper/PCPP-Public/blob/Fall20/week01/OralFeedbackTeaching_students.md

--
### Forming groups
* Some of you already have a group - go ahead if it is welfunctioning
	* I highly recommend same ambition and skill level in the group
- If you do not have a group, we will try to facilitate this in just a moment. 
	* I recognize this to be hard online, and with you not knowing each other. 
	* I therefore expect some groups to restructure in the coming weeks.

---
# Group forming sheet

There is a link from https://github.itu.dk/kasper/PCPP-Public/blob/Fall20/week01/OralFeedbackTeaching_students.md to [this google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ibC0kP9UwPaCRYSKVpj7JX23BKlvn0GD2DZWxBjjmlk/edit?usp=sharing).

### Action now!
* **If you have a group**, it need a name.
	* Find your name, and put a group name next to it. 
* **If you do not have a group**
	* Find your name and write "looking" in the group column. 

--

### Do this now!

---

# Regular lecture tomorrow morning!

--

## Those who have a group are done for today

* Enjoy the rest of your Thursday

--

* Please log out now.

## Those not in a group stay online

---

## Break-out sessions
We will randomly break you up into smaller rooms (a zoom feature) of N each (N decided on the spot). 

In the google sheet, please note the room you are in ("room1"), next to your name (overwriting "looking").

In each room, please present yourself:
* Name
* Where did you get your admission degree from
* Do you work
* Do you have restrictions on when you can collaborate? (like: "I do not study Saturdays before 13").
* Ambition level

### Each room follow the algorithm on next slide

---

# Embarresing group formation algorithm
### Plan A, public proposals
If there is someone who have the courage to ask someone else if they want to be in group, or perhaps are two who need a third - declare your intentions now :-)

---

### Plan B

try{
	
1. First one in the room (by alphabet) tries to form group with the next two in the same room.
	* Make sure you are in agreement on ambition level and work days
	* If something does not match, ask if someone else fits.
2. The last one in the room (by alphabet) do the same, but working upwards in the alphabet.
3. Continue until all are grouped.
