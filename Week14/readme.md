please do the course evaluation (opened on Friday Nov 27).

Questions to the mandatory reading will be adressed at the last lecture on Friday Dec 4.

You may also ask questions to all parts of the course material (readings, lectures and exercises). 
Please ask these in the:
[Questions and Answers for PCPP](https://learnit.itu.dk/mod/forum/view.php?id=123231) on LearnIT.
You may also ask Kasper and JÃ¸rgen to repeat something form the course. We will then do this
at the last lecture on Friday Dec 4.
