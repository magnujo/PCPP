# Basic Java I
The goal of this week is that you:

* Are able to give examples of the three major usages of concurrency.
* Write code that illustrate race conditions, liveness and compound actions, and explain how the problems arise.
* Can use `synchronized` to prevent such concurrency errors.

### Readings
I owe you all an appology for forgetting to set the readings.

I expect you to read: Goetz chap 1,2, and 16.1.
