# Oral feedback at the PCPP course (via zoom)

## Why
Normally you as students will receive feedback on your work in two ways.

* There is an exercise/lab session where you can show up and get help with this weeks exercises
* There is a hand-in deadline, and then some of the teaching assistents will mark your submission and give some written feedback. Usually a few comments and approved/not approved.

In my experience the feedback on the hand-in is sparse and might not be too helpful in your learning the material. 

We will therefore try something different, namely oral feedback on your hand-in, with the primary purpose to make it a two way discussion.

## How
You will form small groups of 2-3 persons. You are very welcome to reuse groups from other classes.

* Each group makes a solution to this weeks exercises and put them at their GitHub (itu has its own GitHub server - github.itu.dk). The link to GitHub is then handed-in via LearnIT (we need a learnit submission, and this is the simplest we can come up with).

Submission deadline is Thursdays at 7am.

Two groups are then allocated a 40-45 min timeslot with one of the teachers or teaching assistants. You are to present your solutions using zoom screen sharing, and teacher/TA can answer questions, provide feedback and ask about the details. The TA will *not* have had time to read the hand-in prior to the meeting.

For practical purposes (as we lack truly parallel TA ressources), some of the groups will get written feedback rather than oral. Who will get which will differ over time.

### Ambition levels

The exercises for each week will be color coded for ambition level (green, yellow, red).

* *Green* are students who wants a 4, but can live with a 2. 
* *Yellow* wants 7, but hope for 10. 
* *Red* will be disappointed if not getting 10 or 12. 

You are encouraged to form groups at the same ambition level, and will be given feedback according to your ambition level. 


## Logistics
At the moment (aug 20.) there are 132 students. The feedback groups are formed on Thursday 27th [using this google-sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ibC0kP9UwPaCRYSKVpj7JX23BKlvn0GD2DZWxBjjmlk/edit?usp=sharing). 

* The sheet has all the students in the class (email kasper@itu.dk if you are missing).
* You form a group by putting the same group name next to each student in a group - Silly group names are encouraged, rude names will not be tolerated. Also, the group should state their ambition level.
* Kasper will then schedule the oral feedback sometime over the weekend.
