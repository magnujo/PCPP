# 10 + 11 Coroutines
In these two lessons we will have a look at coroutines. To this end we will use the programming language kotlin which in our view has the most general and most efficient implementation of coroutines.

The topics covered in these two lectures will not assume prior knowledge of kotlin, and we do not expect you to become prolifient in this language, but understand its syntax well enough to make simple examples and to understand the concepts.

Topics covered:

* kotlins basics
* kotlins streams (called sequences)
* extension methods and trailing lambdas
* Coroutines
    * suspendable functions
    * yield to build stream sources and stream operators
    * How coroutines are implemented in kotlin
    * --- In lesson 11 we will also look at: ----
    * await for interacting with the outside world
    * scaleability
    * Coroutine contexts
    * Channels & flows

The first lecture will focus on the basics of kotlin, and the examples using yield.

If you want see how a lot of developers view different technologies and programming languages, [the anual report from stackoverflow](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020) is a good read.

### Readings
* Online experimentation: [Learn Kotlin by Example](https://play.kotlinlang.org/byExample/overview)
* [Kotlin Coroutines](https://github.com/Kotlin/KEEP/blob/master/proposals/coroutines.md)
    * The [documentation of coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines/coroutines-guide.html) is helpful as well.
* There is [an online playground](https://play.kotlinlang.org) where you can try out small examples without installing the compiler or an IDE.
