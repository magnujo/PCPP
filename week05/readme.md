# 05 Tasks & Executor framework
In most server architectures it is important to stay responsive. This week we will look at the executor framework in Java, which allow one (or more) threads to delegate work to a set of worker threads. 

After this week, you will be able to divide labor between task producing threads, and worker threads using the executor framework. 

On .Net the corresponding thing is [Task Parallel Library (TPL)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/parallel-programming/task-parallel-library-tpl).


### Readings
* Goetz 6, 8-8.2 & 10-10.1.2.

* Not mandatory, but interesting: Goetz chap. 7.<br>
  Chapter 8.3 and forward becomes very technical in its treatment of parameters of threadpools and can be skipped.
