# 03 Design for concurrency
This week we will look at how you design datastructures which should be thread-safe, as well as some of the building blocks Java provides to make that task easier.

If you are rusty on invariants and pre/post conditions, and how that relates to exceptions I suggest the [original paper by Bertand Meyer](DesignByContract_Original.pdf). While no major language addopted his syntax, I have found his way of thinking about software development very useful.
