# Lock free coordination Week 13
## Friday Nov 20th to Thursday Nov 26th

The goal of this week is to get a basic understanding of *Lock free coordination*:

- try Git tools for merge/rebase
- know about various notions of consistency in concurrent systems
- understand the implications of the CAP theorem
- understand how *operation transform* works on text files
- know about *operational transform* in distributed databases



### Readings
The Goetz book does not cover *lock free coordination*, so the reading  this week 
is mainly on-line material and some research papers:

[Operational transform video](https://youtu.be/3ykZYKCK7AM)

[Brewer's Conjecture and the Feasibility of Consistent, Available,
Partition-Tolerant Web Services](GilbertAndLynch.pdf), Read sections 1-3 carefully. 

This paper gives some background information for exercises 13.4.2, 13.4.3, and the lecture slides on *linearizability*:
[Linearizability: A Correctness Condition for Concurrent Objects](WingHerlihyCons.pdf)
It is **not** mandatory reading, but give it a shot anyway.
