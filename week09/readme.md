# Benchmarking
## Friday Oct 23rd to Thursday Oct 29th

The goal of this week is to get a basic understanding of *reactive programming* and some experience with RxJava
(Java implementation of the reactive concepts).

To motivate and gain some experience with reactive programming Java Swing is used to create
some simple user interfaces.


### Readings
The Goetz book does not cover RxJava, so the reading  this week is mainly on-line material and this note
[Concurrency concepts by JÃ¸rgen Staunstrup](concurrency.md)
The note starts by taking a helicopter view on concurrency where we ignore performance details.
Instead the focus is more qualitative identifying a few core concepts that directly reflect
the different motivations for using concurrency. The note is still a draft and might be updated
during the week preceding lecture 9.

These two tutorials are a nice introduction to RxJava, they are oriented to Java for Android, so ignore
the sections specifically  discussing Android and Android studio:

[Reactive Programming Operators](https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/reactive-programming-operators-in-rxjava-20--cms-28396?_ga=2.197046314.723429276.1502526034-1015877821.1497434847)

This tutorial explains how to set up RxJava and gives a number of "toy" examples
