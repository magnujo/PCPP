---

# Plan for today
# Meta - about how this course is organized 

---

# The teachers
* Course responsible: Kasper √òsterbye
- PhD 1989, Aalborg University, programmed my first machine code in 1978 (wrote an assembler in high school)
* Research interests: Programming languages and software understanding
	* Like programming languages üòÄ: Java, C#, Kotlin, JavaScript, Lisp, Python, C++, Smalltalk, Forth, Icon, Prolog, Simula, Pascal, Concurrent Pascal, Beta, Eiffel, ... (excuse me for mixing syntaxes once in a while).
- Joined ITU in 2000 (but has been away for 5 years) 
* Co-teacher: J√∏rgen Staunstrup (will introduce himself later in the course. Was my teacher on concurrency way back)


---
# Standard weekly plan
* Lectures Fridays in zoom
- feedback on Thursdays (zoom), and some written feedback
* Exercise hand-in: Thursday morning by 7
* On LearnIT, as a link to your itu github with solutions
---

# Course information online
* Course LearnIT page, restricted access:
https://learnit.itu.dk/course/view.php?id=3017108

* Course gitrepo:
https://github.itu.dk/kasper/PCPP-Public
- Overview of lectures and exercises
- Lecture slides and exercise sheets
- Example code
- List of all mandatory reading materials

---

# Stuff you need
* Buy Goetz et al: Java Concurrency in Practice - From 2006, still the best on Java concurrency
	- Most contents is relevant for C#/.NET too
* Free lecture notes and papers, will be available in github
* Java 8 SDK installed on your computer - Java 7 or earlier will not work, later should be OK

---
 
# Ambition levels
* We (teachers) acknowledge that you might have different ambition levels for this class and your education.
	* Exercises are in three ambition levels.
		* Green: ‚ÄúI want a 4, but can live with a 2‚Äù.
		* Yellow: ‚ÄúI want a 7, but hope for a 10‚Äù.
		* Red: ‚ÄúI will be disappointed if less than 10‚Äù.
	* Red must do all exercises, Yellow those marked Yellow and Green, and Green only need to do the Green.

* Groups and teams should be same ambition level.

* Feedback according to ambition.


---

# Exercises
* There are 13 sets of weekly exercises
- You are expected to work in groups of 2-3 students, and in teams of two groups. 
	* Your group and team is your primary source for help - you are in this together.
* Hand in the solutions through LearnIT
- Each team will be given oral feedback on Thursday - a schedule will be available.
* Hand-ins: ‚â•6 must be submitted, ‚â•5 approved - otherwise you cannot take the exam
	- failing to get 5 approved costs an exam attempt (!!)
- Exercises each week are color coded. Green level must be done to be approved.

# Github/LearnIT 
#### Only one solution per group
#### Hand-in on LearnIT 
The handin must be a link

# Groups & feedback

There is an explanation of feedback on: 
https://github.itu.dk/kasper/PCPP-Public/blob/Fall20/week01/OralFeedbackTeaching_students.md

--
The idea is that you form groups by finding your name, and typing your group name next to it. All with the same groupname is assumed to be in the same group - two or three persons per group.
